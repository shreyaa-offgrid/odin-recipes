  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Shahi Paneer is a royal North Indian dish made with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) simmered in a rich, creamy gravy of onions, tomatoes, cashews, and aromatic spices. Known for its mildly sweet taste and luxurious texture, it’s a popular choice in restaurants and festive meals.

    The word “Shahi” means royal, and this dish lives up to its name with the use of ghee, cream, and warm spices. It's best served with naan, roti, or jeera rice, making for a hearty, satisfying vegetarian main course.
