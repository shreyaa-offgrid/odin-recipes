  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Chhole Bhature is a beloved North Indian dish that pairs spicy chickpea curry (chhole) with deep-fried, fluffy bread (bhature). It’s often enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or a special weekend indulgence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chhole are cooked in a rich, tangy tomato-onion gravy with a mix of warm spices, while the bhature are made from a fermented dough and fried until golden and puffed. This dish is best served with sliced onions, pickles, and a glass of lassi.
