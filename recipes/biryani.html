  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken Biryani is a fragrant, spiced rice dish layered with marinated chicken and caramelized onions. A beloved classic in Indian cuisine, it combines rich flavors and aromas from whole spices, fresh herbs, and saffron.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chicken is marinated in a blend of ginger, garlic, herbs, and warm spices, then cooked and layered with partially boiled basmati rice. Everything is steamed together ("dum") to lock in flavor and create a truly regal meal. This dish is perfect for special occasions or weekend indulgence.
